# Nutritional Data Analysis: Exploring Correlations in Dietary Habits

## Project Overview
This project analyzes food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) data from 54 respondents to explore relationships between nutritional intake and demographic variables. Based on a FiveThirtyEight article highlighting the challenges of interpreting nutritional research, this analysis demonstrates the importance of distinguishing correlation from causation in health data.
